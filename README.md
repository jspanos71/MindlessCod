# MindlessCod

This data pack changes naturally spawned Cod to have no AI.  The schooling behavior of Cod can
cause terrible lag if oceans are loaded in the world.  This datapack will help to minimize the impact
by erasing the Cod's AI.  They will no longer swim, or look for other Cod to school with.

Cod that are caught and released from buckets are not impacted, so your aquariums are safe!

On a moderately busy server we routinely saw Cod taking 20% of the tick time.  After this datapack
was enabled that dropped to less than 2%.  

There is a restore function to return the Cod to normal if you wish to undo the changes made by the pack.

Get your TPS back and laugh at the mindless Cod!

To install:
Drop the MindlessCod.zip in your /world/datapacks folder and then execute the /reload command (or restart).
